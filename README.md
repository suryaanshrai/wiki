# Wiki
This is a basic clone of Wikipedia based on django. This is also my submission for project 1 of the CS50 Web course.

## Running the application
To locally run the application, do the following: 
- Install git and Django if not already installed
- Clone the repository by executing `https://github.com/suryaanshrai/wiki.git` in the terminal
- Run `python manage.py runserver`, to start the server and goto `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see the site in action
